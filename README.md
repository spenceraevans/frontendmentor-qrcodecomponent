### My Process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS 

### What I learned

I really used this challenge to help me continue to practice my HTML and CSS skills. I found this challenge to be relativley simple and was able to complete it in a short time. My only struggle was getting the media queries to work so I could make the page responsive to different size screens which I was able to get eventually.

### Continued development

Understanding positioning is something I am still working on. I was able to figure this one out pretty easily but I know future projects may require more complicated positionings. Also media queries are still pretty new to me so learning to adapt code to smaller or bigger screens I know is important. 

### Useful resources

- [W3 Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp) - I used this W3 schools resource to help me with the media queries and I was able to understand what I needed to do pretty well
